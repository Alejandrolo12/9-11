Competencies

Up until now all programs weâ€™ve written have been on the command line, now with the sinatra framework, we can start putting our code onto the web
Sinatra is a lightweight web framework for Ruby 
Does not strictly follow the Model View Controller pattern of app development, but you can still implement the separation
Can start sinatra from scratch, or work off a skeleton. There are many skeletons out there on the web, understand what each file does and decide which one is right for you
Since Sinatra gets our code onto the Web, we will be coming back to HTML/CSS and incorporating Ruby as well. 
Ruby is incorporated into HTML through the ERB (Embedded Ruby) extension, and has special syntax
